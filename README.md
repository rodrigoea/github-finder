# Github Finder Application

## Description

This application was developed due to participation in the Shaw and Partners job process.

**I've decided to share the code for references :)**

## How to use

Clone the repository:

```hash
git clone https://github.com/rodrigolabs/github-finder
```

Install the dependencies:

```hash
yarn install

or

npm install
```

Run locally:

```hash
yarn start
```

## Env Configuration

To have a proper configuration, a `.env` file should be created with the needed values:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

_There's already a .env.example file that can be used as an example._
